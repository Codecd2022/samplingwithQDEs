% The Matlab program consists of 6 .m files in the attachments. To run the
% codes, quaternion toolbox is needed, see S. J. Sangwine and N. Le Bihan,
% “Quaternion Toolbox for Matlab®,” [Online], 2005, software library

% For example, to compute sample points for N=12, s=1, just input
% samplepoint(12,1) as follows
